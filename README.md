### PES Project 1 Readme
## Tristan Duenas
The repository contains three directories. One for each program (programOne, programTwo, programThree).
Each program contains a Makefile to build the source and header files in that folder.
GCC C99 is the designated compiler in the Makefile, and -Wall and Werror compiler flags are set during compilation.

In order to build and execute Program One, run the following commands in ECEN5813_Project_1/ProgramOne/:
- make
- ./ProgramOne value radix operand_size | ProgramOne.out

In order to build and execute Program Two, run the following commands ECEN5813_Project_1/ProgramTwo/:
- make
- ./ProgramTwo acii_code | ProgramTwo.out

In order to build and execute Program Three, run the following commands ECEN5813_Project_1/ProgramThree/:
- make
- ./ProgramThree | ProgramThree.out

## ProgramOne.Out will be found in ECEN5813_Project_1/ProgramOne/
## ProgramTwo.Out will be found in ECEN5813_Project_1/ProgramTwo/
## ProgramThree.Out will be found in ECEN5813_Project_1/ProgramThree/
