### PES Project 1 Readme
## Tristan Duenas
The repository contains three directories. One for each program (programOne, programTwo, programThree).
Each program contains a Makefile to build the source and header files in that folder.
GCC C99 is the designated compiler in the Makefile, and -Wall and Werror compiler flags are set during compilation.

In order to build and execute Program One, run the following commands in ECEN5813_Project_1/ProgramOne/:
- make
- ./ProgramOne "{-6,10,4},{-6,9,4},{-6,10,5},{-9,10,4},{237,10,8},{0354,8,8},{0xEB,16,8},{-125,10,8},{65400,10,8},{65400,10,16},{-32701,10,16}" > ProgramOne.out

In order to build and execute Program Two, run the following commands ECEN5813_Project_1/ProgramTwo/:
- make
- ./ProgramTwo "{66,114,117,99,101,32,83,97,121,115,32,72,105,33,7,9,50,48,49,57}" > ProgramTwo.out

In order to build and execute Program Three, run the following commands ECEN5813_Project_1/ProgramThree/:
- make
- ./ProgramThree > ProgramThree.out

## ProgramOne.Out will be found in ECEN5813_Project_1/ProgramOne/
## ProgramTwo.Out will be found in ECEN5813_Project_1/ProgramTwo/
## ProgramThree.Out will be found in ECEN5813_Project_1/ProgramThree/
